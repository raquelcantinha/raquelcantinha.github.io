      <p>Hi! I'm a Junior Front-End Dev and have created this website to showcase my work and skills. </p>
      <p>Because of a professional background of multidisciplinary experiences in Arts, Architecture, and teaching, 
        I was in contact with different people and fields of knowledge.</p>
      <p>I learned the importance of empathy for design thinking and the development of every kind of product - and that is the sense that leds me in 
        my journey in UI Design and Front-End Development.</p>

          <h3>Context</h3>
          <p>This project was created during the Senac EAD course on programming logic. The main goal was to develop a tool that allows the calculation 
            of a grade point average and uses it as a basis to generate the academic status.</p>

          <h3>A little more about it</h3>
          <p>In this exercise I started to learn how to work with user interaction, taking the result to be typed 
            in an input, assigning it to a variable, and developing, in a logical way, an algorithm that would 
            convert this value.</p>
          <p>Then I learned how to display results on the screen, using "innerHTML".</p>
          <p>A challenge for me was adding other currencies to the conversion. I first repeated the function for 
            each currency, but realized that the code was too long, and thought that maybe there was a way to 
            reduce it without affecting its functionality. To do this, I added arguments to the function.</p>
          <p>Another challenge was to create the button that would erase the data from the input and return the 
            initial text written in the field where the converted value is displayed. To do this, I worked with 
            "reset" on the input, and "textContent" of the displayed value.</p>
          <p>When sharing the project, I received a suggestion to make the button of the currency chosen for 
            conversion active when clicked. This challenge I have not been able to develop yet, but it is a next 
            step that I intend to take in this project.</p>
          <p>I thought the layout design as a very simple screen. At first I designed everything (the texts and the converter) 
            together, inside the same visual element, but later I realized that it would make more sense if the converter was the 
            main element, separated from the auxiliar texts. The colors were chosen as a reference to the banknotes and the coins colors.</p>

            <h3>A little more about it</h3>
            <p>This was my first exercise working with JavaScript. I started it during "Programming Logic" classes. At first 
            the ideia was to develop an algorithm that could sum grades values that a student obtained during four quarters,
            and then, calculate the grade point average, dividing the sum by four.</p>
            <p>I worked with user interaction to get the value typed on each input, and then, through "parseFloat", 
              interpret each value as a number. Then, through a "function", sum these values and divide them, getting the grade point average.</p>
            <p>The next step was to define if the student was approved or not. Here I worked with "conditional statements" for the first 
              time. The minimum grade point average for being approved is 7, if the function result is equal or higher than 
              this, than the student is approved, else, he/she isn't.</p>
            <p>To work with JavaScript was a challenge, and so was the layout design. Wanting to present the functionalities
               and the text parts in an organized nad intuitive way, to make the user interaction with the webpage easier as
              possible, I decided to divide the screen in three parts, highlighting the middle part, where I placed the
              calculator, considering that this is the main part of the webpage.</p>
            <p>I decided to work with a colorful background based on target audience's profile (teenagers that would be school's students) 
              and also to take out the "weight" that a grade calculation can generate, in addition to presenting a school application in a 
              more user-friendly way. So, even if you are not approved, it could send you the message "don't worry, we are going to help you 
              to go through it".</p>
